# ASM_World ‚õè

**Developing in asm... w00t??**

I consider this repo an 'informal' backup of Assembly code snippets I often refer to when writing shellcode. 

*Feel free to explore!*

**Code**:
* Code_01.asm		(standard remote shellcode injection) - NASM
*	Code_02.asm		(standard call to LoadLibraryA) - NASM
* Code_03.asm   (XOR encryption example instructions) - NASM
* Code_04.asm   (Function call obfuscation procedure / Dinamically resolving function addresses for shellcode implementations) - NASM
* Code_05.asm   (Find process basic information (name, pid)) - NASM
* (new code will be released soon!!)
