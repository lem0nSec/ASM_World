**Developing random offensive security code in asm just for fun!!**


Why is this useful?

This repo aims to illustrate how common offensive security tactics work in practice. By doing so, we are able to fully take advantage of these techniques and try to figure out how to improve them and create new variants!

Code:
* Code_01.asm		(standard remote shellcode injection) - NASM
*	Code_02.asm		(standard call to LoadLibraryA) - NASM
* Code_03.asm   (XOR encryption example instructions) - NASM
* Code_04.asm   (Function call obfuscation procedure / Dinamically resolving function addresses for shellcode implementations) - NASM
* (new code will be released soon!!)
