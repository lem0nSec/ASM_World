# ASM_World ‚õè

**Developing in asm... w00t??**

I consider this repo as an 'informal' backup of Assembly code snippets I often use when writing shellcode. So I don't need to rewrite the same code every time. 
*Feel free to explore!*

Code:
* Code_01.asm		(standard remote shellcode injection) - NASM
*	Code_02.asm		(standard call to LoadLibraryA) - NASM
* Code_03.asm   (XOR encryption example instructions) - NASM
* Code_04.asm   (Function call obfuscation procedure / Dinamically resolving function addresses for shellcode implementations) - NASM
* Code_05.asm   (Find process basic information (name, pid)) - NASM
* (new code will be released soon!!)
